# Hangman-Game
This is the traditional hangman game. It will fetch a random two words from an API and will return the words as asteriks so that the user can guess letter by letter and eventually, the words. If the user guesses a correct letter then the letter will show up in place of the asterik in every occurence of it in both of the words. If the user makes an incorrect guess then the number of guesses the user has left will decrease by one. 

The user wins the game by either figuring out the word within the alloted number of guesses or fails the game by running out of guesses without guessing the words. If the user types in a letter that has already been guessed nothing will happen.
